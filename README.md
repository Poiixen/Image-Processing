This project involves developing a program for image processing. It includes functionalities such as reading binary .TGA image files, processing their data, and writing modified images back to .TGA files. 

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**: Compile the project using the provided makefile by executing the `make` command in the command-line interface within the directory containing the source code (`src` folder).
   
2. **Execution**: After compilation, execute the program by running the generated executable file (named `project2.out`).

3. **Functionality**:
   - The program reads .TGA files and performs various image processing operations such as changing pixel colors, applying blending modes, and modifying individual color channels.
   - Detailed instructions on using the program functionalities can be found within the source code documentation and comments.

4. **Testing**: Ensure the program runs correctly by verifying that the output images match the expected results after applying the desired image processing operations.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting at least C++11 standard.
- Basic understanding of image file formats and image processing concepts.

## Note

- Avoid hardcoding paths to files and use relative paths instead for better portability across different systems.
- Ensure the C++ version is specified in the makefile for compatibility purposes.
